----------------------------

# Using the Library
1. Use the [zip link][1] to download the source
2. Extract the contents to a new folder called RTCDS1307
3. Move this folder into your arduino libraries folder (mine is in my home directory ~/sketchbook/libaries You might need to create yours.)
3. View the example program to see how to read and set the time.
